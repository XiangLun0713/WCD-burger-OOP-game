# WCD-burger-OOP-game
**WCD Burger** is a two-series minigame developed for the [**Apptitude Challenge**](https://apptitude-challenge.com/), a free self-paced challenge held virtually in collaboration with one of the worldâ€™s tech giants - **Huawei** under **Odyssey Hackfest**. This two-series minigame aims to introduce beginners to basic OOP concepts, including class creation using constructors, Abstraction and Inheritance through fun and enjoyable learning experiences. 

## About WCD Burger
The WCD Burger is a classic burger game that we all are familiar with, but with an interesting twist. In WCD Burger, customers give orders in Java programming syntax, and the players are required to make the correct burger accordingly. The game consists of the story mode as well as the endless mode where the common goal for both modes is to earn as much gold as possible, to keep the restaurant running. The game also consists of a leaderboard to introduce competitiveness into the game. The first series of the WCD Burger introduces the players to class creation using various types of constructors, whereas the second series of the WCD Burger (WCD Burger 2.0) introduces the players to Inheritance and Abstraction concepts.

## Showcase website
The game is originally accessible through the Apptitude Challenge official website. However, since the challenge is now over, I've created a separate [**showcase website**](https://xianglun0713.github.io/WCD-burger-OOP-game/) to let every one of you try out this minigame. Have fun! 

\*\*_Note that only the first series of the minigame is accessible at this stage._

## Summary
It is overall a fun process developing this minigame. From receiving supportive feedback from the testers along the way to seeing it gets deployed to the public and finally, the crazy competition among players in the leaderboard is truly an unforgettable experience. Through this development process, I learnt to:
- Develop WebGL game using Unity Game Engine and C# programming language.
- Create enjoyable and unique gaming experience with a carefully crafted game design.
- Create an in-game leaderboard using Firebase.
- Create a showcase website using Reactjs.
- Deploy a Reactjs app using GitHub Pages.  
- Always ask for feedback. 
- Ask for help instead of trying to do everything by myself.
