"I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!"
It's your first day working part-time at the WcD fast food restaurant.
In order to test your abilities, your boss has specially sent you to the kitchen to make hamburgers.
Upon arrival in the kitchen, you find that it does not seem to be quite the scene you imagined.
Faced with displays full of Java code and an entire staff in plaid shirts, you wonder, "Am I ... really in the kitchen?"
That being said, the work still needs to be done.
