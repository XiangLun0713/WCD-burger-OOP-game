Congratulations! You are already an excellent programmer - I mean, an excellent burger chef!
The boss is impressed to see how quickly you've fitted into the working environment.
"I was concerned that you might face difficulties changing your mindset due to your previous role as a programmer, but now it seems that I was worried about nothing."
... You were about to say something, but you thought better of it.
